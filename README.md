# Nigerian Senators

Know the senator representing you in the senate and reach out to them to make your voice heard!

This project was brought about by the recent senate bill that aims to restrict social media usage.

Although the bill was masked as trying to curb the spread of fake news, this is against the fundamental right to free speech of every Nigerian.
